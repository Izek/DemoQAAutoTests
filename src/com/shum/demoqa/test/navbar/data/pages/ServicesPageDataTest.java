The point of using ‘lorem ipsum’ is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘This here is content’ or ‘Osama Bin Laden wanted dead or alive’, making it look like readable text and there also has been many examples what has happened if someone has forgotten to change the dummy text for the final copywrite text.\nIn Finland there was couple of years ago this one bookshop banner in public internet with ‘Buying a book is as easy as hitting a child’ text in it.";
